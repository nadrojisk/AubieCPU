# AubieCPU

## Purpose

This repository is for the projects for the Computer Architecture class offered at Auburn Univeristy (Fall 2018) by Dr. Richard Chapman.

## Summary

### Lab 1

This lab had students create a VHDL program that has three inputs and one output. 
The labs main focus was to just get us familiar with ModelSim and VHDL.

### Lab 2

In this lab students are tasked with creating an arithmetic-logic unit. The ALU can perform the following operations: `unsigned add`, `unsigned subtract`, `signed add`, `signed subtract`, signed multiply`, `signed divide`, `logical AND`, `bitwise AND`, `logical OR`, `bitwise OR`, `logical NOT`, `bitwise NOT`.

### Lab 3

Lab 3 requires the students to generate logic for registers that will be used by the Aubie processor.

### Lab 4

In this lab we put everything together by implementing the control block of the Aubie processor.
